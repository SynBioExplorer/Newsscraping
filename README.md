- **Gauge Sentiment**: Identify sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) across news articles and Twitter comments.
- **Track Public Reaction**: Understand shifts in public sentiment in the days and weeks after the event.
- **Compare Sources**: Highlight differences between sentiment in news media and social media, revealing biases or disparities in coverage.

#### Data Sources
- **Google News**: Collects news articles specifically targeting the Capitol events, allowing analysis of sentiment in formal media reporting.
- **Twitter**: Gathers tweets based on relevant keywords and hashtags to capture real-time public reactions and discussions.

#### Key Features
- **Automated Data Collection**: Scrapes Google News articles and Twitter comments programmatically.

#### Analysis Summary and Conclusions

1. **Dominant Negative Sentiment**:  
   Both Google News articles and Twitter comments reveal a high level of negative sentiment immediately after the storming, indicating broad public and media disapproval.

2. **Temporal Shifts in Sentiment**:
   - **Twitter Comments**: Initial negative responses on Twitter evolve over time, showing a gradual shift towards more neutral discussions as the public discourse adapts to subsequent developments.
   - **Google News**: News articles maintain a consistent tone, often negative or neutral, focusing on reporting facts and analyzing the event’s impact.

3. **Differences Between Media and Public Sentiment**:
   - **News Media**: Tends to present a steadier, more measured sentiment, often neutral or negative, particularly in articles emphasizing governance, legal implications, or democratic processes.
   - **Social Media**: Twitter comments display more emotional variance, including spikes in both negative and positive sentiment, reflecting a wider array of public perspectives.

4. **Peak Sentiment Days**:
   Specific dates, often aligning with major follow-up events or political actions, show heightened levels of negative sentiment. These peaks highlight the public’s reaction to ongoing developments related to the Capitol events.

5. **Polarization in Twitter Sentiment**:
   Twitter commentary shows a polarized sentiment distribution, with a mix of strong negative sentiment and occasional positive sentiments. This polarization reflects the diversity in public opinion and varying reactions within different segments of the population.

#### Insights for Future Research
This analysis provides a framework for examining public and media sentiment surrounding significant events. By tracking sentiment trends over time and across platforms, this approach can be extended to other events to gauge societal impacts and understand differences in media versus public perspectives. Future research could expand by including additional media platforms or conducting more granular analyses across demographics to further enhance these insights.
